# Define a vector called h.

# Create an empty vector called s.
# This is necessary because when you introduce a variable within the for-loop,
# R will not remember it when it has gotten out of the for-loop.

# The next lines contain the for-loop.
# In this case, i is the counter and runs from 2 to 10.
# Everything between the curly brackets is processed 9 times.
# The first time i=2, the second element of h is multiplied with 10
# and placed in the second position of the vector s.
# The second time i=3, etc.
# In the last two runs, the 9th and 10th elements of h are requested, which do not exist.
# Note that these statements are evaluated without any explicit error messages.
