# Introduction 
  
This is my first RMarkdown document! 
  
# Let's embed some R code 
  
Let's load the **Gapminder** data: 

```{r} 
library(dplyr) 
library(readr) 
gm <- read_csv('../data/gapminder.csv') 
head(gm) 
``` 

The mean life expectancy is `r mean(gm$lifeExp)` years. 

The years surveyed in this data include: `r unique(gm$year)`. 

# Session Information 

```{r} 
sessionInfo() 
```
